<b> 1. Dice Roll Simulation ðŸŽ² </b>
This experiment involves:

Rolling 10 dice per trial and calculating the sum of their outcomes.
Running trials with sample sizes from 100 to 10,000 rolls.
Plotting the distribution of the sums, revealing how the shape of the histogram approaches a normal distribution with more trials.

<b> 2. Coin Flip Simulation ðŸª™ </b> 
In this experiment:

Each trial consists of 100 coin flips where each flip outcome is either +1 (heads) or -1 (tails).
Summing up results for each trial, and repeating this with sample sizes from 100 to 10,000 trials.
Observing how the sums form a bell curve as the sample size increases, reinforcing the CLT's concept.
ðŸ“ˆ Results
Each experiment generates histograms that visualize how the distribution of sample means or sums approaches normality with increasing sample size. These visual proofs help demystify the CLT and showcase how even binary or discrete outcomes can result in a normal distribution when averaged or summed over a large number of trials.

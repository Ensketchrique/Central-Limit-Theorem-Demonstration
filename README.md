# Central-Limit-Theorem-Demonstration
This project demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) through dice roll and coin flip simulations. As sample sizes grow, the distributions of sums approach a normal shape. Using Python and Seaborn, it visually showcases how CLT works, offering a clear, practical grasp of this key statistical concept.

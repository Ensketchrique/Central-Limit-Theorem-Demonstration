# Project Overview
The Central Limit Theorem states that, given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the mean of a random variable will approach a normal distribution, regardless of the original data's distribution. This is a cornerstone in statistics, providing a basis for making inferences about population parameters.

In this repository, we will:

Simulate Dice Rolls - Observe how sums of dice rolls form a normal distribution.
Simulate Coin Flips - See how binary outcomes can also yield a normal distribution for aggregated results.
These examples highlight the essence of the CLT and its practical application in understanding data behavior in various fields.

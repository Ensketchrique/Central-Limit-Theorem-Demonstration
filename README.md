# Central-Limit-Theorem-Demonstration
Welcome to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Demonstration repository! This project illustrates the concept of the Central Limit Theorem through two hands-on experiments using Dice Rolls and Coin Flips. The project is designed to visually explain the CLT, its importance in statistics, and its applications in data science.
